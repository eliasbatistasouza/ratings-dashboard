## üè¨ Business Problem

The Ratings Company is a restaurant marketplace. In other words, its core business is to facilitate meetings and negotiations between customers and restaurants. Restaurants register within the platform, provide information such as address, type of cuisine served, if they accept reservations, if they make deliveries and an evaluation note of the restaurant's services and products, among other information.

The platform has just hired a new CEO, who wants the data team to help him identify important KPIs of the company, answering the business questions he asks using data. These key points should be presented in the form of a interactive dashboard, that allows for fast and assertive decision making.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution

The chosen problem solving strategy consists of using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to sumarize the main characteristics of the dataset. Using numerical mesures such as averages, standard deviation, sum and count, to evaluate the performance of the, Countries, Cities, Restaurants and Cuisine Types present on the platform. These measures were used to identify which Countries, Cities, Restaurants and Cuisine Types are performing better, either in terms of popularity among customers, quality of products and services offered, positive reviews, among other criteria. 

The main findings of the analysis were presented in a interactive dashboard that can be accessed online, allowing the user to visualize the data from anywhere at anytime. 

The dashboard metrics were based on the main players of the company's business model, those are:

- Overall Metrics
- Country Metrics
- City Metrics
- Restaurant Metrics
